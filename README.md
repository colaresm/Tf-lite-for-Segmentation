# TFlite for Segmentation
This project demonstrates how to use a segmentation model trained in TensorFlow and convert it to TensorFlow Lite for execution in C++ on both Mac and Windows operating systems. The focus is on image segmentation, using a model previously trained in TensorFlow and performing inference on devices with TensorFlow Lite.
